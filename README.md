# BALANCE_BOT

Parts List: 

-2 Hoverboard Hub Motors 
-20 18650 3.6v cells  
-an arduino nano 
-MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer module
-housing for baterry/hardware with weight offset at around 45degrees
-a normal open toggle switch to kill the wheels if the cover is off
-36v 16amp 10s PCB Lithium battery protection board
-Jetson Nano Dev board
-Odrive3.6 56v Motor Controller 


    This project was created as an effort to gain 
     Understanding of gyroscopic stabilization

     This project also has become an effort to
     understand how feedback control loops operate.

    Minor adjustments in wheel acceleration must be
    made in order to counter act the bot falling in
    either one direction or the other

    A PID Loop will used to determine wheel rotation
