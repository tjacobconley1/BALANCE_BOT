# BALANCE_BOT

Parts List: 

-2 Hoverboard Hub Motors 
-A 36v-42v Battery made of those small lithium cells 
-an arduino nano 
-MPU6050 gyro/accelerometer module
-custom designed chassis (I will also upload my files from Fusion360) 
-some threaded rods 



I still need to make a wiring diagram and probably a few more mounting pieces for the hardware. 

The plan is to learn how gyroscopic balancing works thoroughly and then slap this sweet Jetson Chip with a 128core GPU I ordered
on top to do some machine learning and maybe even turn it into a robot that automatically takes your trash cans to the road or something
